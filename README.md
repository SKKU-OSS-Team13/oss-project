## A brief overview

Our web page("오늘 뭐 입지?") recommends clothes based on weather. After receiving the user's location and current time automatically,  
it shows :

1. the weather from now to after 10 hours, and recommended clothes accordingly.(The user can also set the location through regional search)

2. the recommended clothes according to the temperature as the most basic clothing image and text.
3. the recommendation text to pack umbrellas or outerwear depending on the probability of precipitation and daily temperature difference.

4. a full-body coordination picture that people wear at the current temperature, and show another recommended coordination picture when clicking the button.

Also, the weather and recommended clothes are sent to the user's e-mail every morning if user wants.
